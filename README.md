# Hello-World
Aloha, Everyone

My name is Adrian Thomas. I write poetry, listen to death metal, eat as healthily as possible, fight, and wander. That is my lifestyle.
I have many hobbies including: reading philosophy,fishing, hockey, gardening, stand-up comedy. Anything I wish to try I will do so.
Talking is not my strong suit. Talking about myself I find icredibly dis-interesting. I am more of a listener because I enjoy getting out of my head into another.
Would you say that your more of a listener or a speaker?
